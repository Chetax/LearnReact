## Learning Topics

## React JSX

- **What is JSX?**:<br> JSX, or JavaScript XML, is an extension to JavaScript used primarily with React to describe what the UI should look like. It allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, simplifying the creation of React elements.

### JSX Variables and Rendering Logic

When working with JSX, understanding how to handle variables and conditional rendering is fundamental. Let's explore some essential concepts.

### Working with Variables in JSX

In JSX, declaring and using variables follows the standard JavaScript syntax:

```javascript
function Greeting() {
  const Name = "Chetan"; // String
  const Age = 19; // Number
  const topics = ['JSX', 'Redux', 'React']; // Array

  return <h1>Hello, {Name}</h1>;
}
```  
### Conditional Rendering with Ternary Operator

For conditional rendering in JSX, use the ternary operator condition ? expression1 : expression2:

```
const age = 19;
const message = age > 18 ? "Mature" : "Kid";
```  
### CLooping in JSX using .map()

To iterate over arrays and render in JSX, use the map() method:

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
  <li key={number.toString()}>
    {number}
  </li>
);

When using map() for rendering components in React, always assign a unique key to each rendered item to avoid issues with React's reconciliation.
const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) =>
  <li key={index}>
    {todo.text}
  </li>
);
```
